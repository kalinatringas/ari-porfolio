        <p className="m-auto p-5 grid text-xl text-white">My nameâ€™s Arianne Paul-Forton, currently a full-time student in my fourth year of college. Having already completed my A.A. degree as a Mass 
            Communicator at Broward College, I am now on the path of accomplishing my studies with a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Film and TV Production at 
            the University of Florida. With an ongoing aspiration of post-producing and video editing Music Video projects, my purpose is to create content that 
            connects, inspires, and represents people like me. <br/>
            In my work, I want to reflect hope, resilience, and a reminder to keep moving forward. I cherish the initiative of wanting to learn because you get to 
            understand others' realities, cultures, and identities. I love to learn new things and reach my own achievements with full determination, and dedication 
            and surprise myself, we live once after all. I am an open-minded person, I like talking about current social issues, seeing everybody's perspectives of 
            the world, and seeing how all the ideas of people from a large range of differences and backgrounds, could create a final product or conclusion together</p>
